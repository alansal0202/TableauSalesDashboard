**Profit:** Total profit generated from the sale of these products

**Quantity:** Total amount of items sold

**Product Categories:** Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology

**Location (Region):** Central US, East US, South US, West US

## Summary of Insights
**Sales:** 
- Overall sales were up 20.4% compared to the previous year. Additionally, sales performances increased month over month, with February being the lowest performing sales month and November being the highest performing sales month. This upward trend suggests that sales numbers are only going to improve going into the next year. 
- Machines experiences the biggest sales drop of all products, selling $12k less than the previous year in 2023, experiencing a 22% drop in performance. 
- Biggest % drop in sales by market (vs PY): 
  - Central US: 79% drop in Copier sales
  - East US: 53% drop in Machine sales
  - South US: 25% drop in Machine sales
  - West US: 67% drop in supplies sales

**Profit:** 
- Profit was up 14.2% compared to the previous year, mostly due to the spike in profit in March 2023, which outperformed the previous year's profit by 308%
- The biggest profit loss in 2023 was in Tables, which saw a $8k decrease in profits, despite sales numbers being consistent vs the previous year.
- Least profitable products by market (vs PY): 
  - Central US: Binders, Tables
  - East US: Supplies, Tables
  - South US: Machines, Tables
  - West US: Machines

**Quantity:** 
- Quantity of items sold is up 26.8% compared to the previous year, having trends similar to that of sales, with February being the lowest performing month and november being the highest performing month.
- Although Oct. 2023 saw an increase of 47.7% of items sold, it experienced a 42.9% drop in profit vs the previous year. Similarly, although Dec. 2023 saw an increase of 21.8% of items sold, that month also saw a decrease of 52.6% in profits generated vs the previous years. This suggests that some items sold in these months were sold at a loss too big to be compensated by the sale of other items

## Recommendations & Next Steps
- Look into the sales records of items that saw the biggest drop in performance by market, investigate possible causes for the drop in performance, and determine what can be done to increase sales of these products in their relevant markets.
- Investigate least profitable products by market and compare the numbers to other markets to determine what can be done to increase the profitability of these items in their relevant markets. Why is this item producing a profit in this market, but not in that one?
- Investigate which items have the lowest quantity:profit ratio, and see what can be done to increase this ratio, or if we can use these items to push customers to buy items with a larger quantity:profit ratio
